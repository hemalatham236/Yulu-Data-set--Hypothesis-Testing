    "- Understand **how different factors influence the number of bikes rented**.\n",
    "- Identify **patterns and trends** in user behavior.\n",
    "- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to optimize operations, bike availability, and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to help management make better business decisions such as:\n",
    "- **Forecasting demand** for future planning.\n",
    "- **Improving fleet management** by ensuring bikes are available when and where theyâ€™re needed most.\n",
    "- **Designing marketing strategies** based on customer usage patterns.\n",
    "- **Enhancing profitability** by aligning resources with customer demand patterns.\n",
